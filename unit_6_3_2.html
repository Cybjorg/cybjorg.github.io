                    <p>Our job as teachers requires that we do our utmost to work alongside parents.&nbsp;Addressing parent concerns or criticisms is a major part of a teacher's responsibility.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>It is wrong to think that we will be the perfect teacher for all of our students and we will not get any criticisms. Children are different and they come to us with different abilities, different needs and from different families with
                        different values. Even the wisest and most effective teachers will find their methods and decisions questioned by parents.<br></p>
                    <p>Learning how to respond, when to ask for help, who to go to and who to inform regarding a parent communication to you is an essential skill that you will develop over time.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>The point of this lesson is to begin your learning journey with recognizing: (a) this is a needed skill, (b) I am expected to ask for help and inform others about some criticisms and how I should respond and (c) my feelings are my
                        best guide in directing how I will plan my response.<br></p>
                    <p>Most parent criticisms will be communicated to you by email or during a conversation after school or at a scheduled meeting such as a the Parent - Teacher conferences. Sometimes parent communications will be relayed to you through
                        a supervisor or division coordinator.&nbsp;<br></p>
