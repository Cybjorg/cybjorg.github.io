                        <p class="mb-0" style="font-size: 16px;">One great metaphor for being a teacher is to see ourselves as a captain of a learning ship. In this imaginary journey, our role as captain is make decisions that affect what our students learn, how fast we cover the territory and
                            to respond to “stormy” conditions that affect this journey.<br><br>Do you think as captain you will direct a ship where the weather is always warm with gentle breezes pushing you where need to go each day? Of course not, and
                            as you begin this journey of becoming the captain of your learning ship, you must prepare yourself for all sorts of weather along the way.<br><br>A key aspect of this metaphor is how a captain always has others on board to
                            guide them. There is a navigator to help you! There are old sailors on board to help read the weather ahead. Even if you are going into uncharted territories, there are those around you that have seen similar currents and coastlines.
                            Your job as a beginning teacher is to access the wisdom of others and believe in yourself as much as we believe in you.<br><br>Parent complaints are “stormy weather” in the life of a teacher. Fortunately, with help and guidance
                            we can learn to sail these “stormy seas” with confidence. Surviving a storm on your learning ship means being prepared for wind and waves&nbsp;<strong>before</strong>&nbsp;the storm comes. Here are some ways to prepare for
                            those stormy days we all face as teachers.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Most parent communications will be positive in nature or are simply asking a direct question to help them help their child. Respond:<br></p>
                    <ul class="noIndent">
                        <li>before the end of the working day;<br></li>
                        <li>check your grammar;<br></li>
                        <li>use a professional style in writing; and<br></li>
                        <li>ensure you are using a positive tone.<br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some parent concerns will be much more complicated, may include accusatory or wrong information from the parent and, will need thoughtful discussions with peers, mentors, counselors and possibly supervisors before a reply&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the following day</span></strong>.
                        Here are some keys to successfully navigating these stormy waters:<br></p>
                    <ul class="noIndent">
                        <li>take notice of your feelings – if you feel attacked, angry or defensive STOP and find exactly which words create strong emotions for you, which words you agree with, which might be false information;<br></li>
                        <li>discuss the parent concern with a TeachTurtle mentor and a trusted colleague then, with their advice you will know who else to include such as counselors and administrators before replying.<br></li>
                        <li>never answer them in a way that you might send communications to friends or by SMS text and again, check your spelling and grammar and respond professionally.&nbsp;Some emails, however, are much more complicated than the ones referred
                            to in this paragraph. But how will you know?<br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The main reasons you need to communicate with colleagues and supervisors is a parent who “emotionally attacks” you, will have a history of doing this with other teachers. You need to find out from colleagues what might have worked
                        in the past with this parent.<br></p>
                    <p>As a new teacher, sometimes we feel we should be able to handle our problems by ourselves. Nothing could be further from the truth when receiving criticisms or concerns from parents. Even after four decades of teaching, I still ask
                        others to review my responses before sending them.<br></p>
