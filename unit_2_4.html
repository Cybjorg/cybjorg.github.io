                    <p class="lead">Having what it takes to become a teacher is only one part of the equation. The other part is understanding the human developmental stages and the educational implications for each stage. In this lesson, we use Jean Piaget's developmental
                        stages and compare the educational needs for each stage.</p>
                    <p>The objective of this lesson is that you grow a better understanding of the teaching and learning needs for the various stages which will help you in your teaching career.<br></p>
